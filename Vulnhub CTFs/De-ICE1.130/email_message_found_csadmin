Message: Hey Mark, I am curious if you would be free to come over and 
visit for my son Donovin's birthday tomorrow after work.  I would also 
appreciate if you brought Andy with you as well, because Donny 
really enjoyed playing with him last time he was over.  I know its short 
notice but he is turning 12 and it is special for both him and me. Let 
me know if this works. Thanks!  -Paul
