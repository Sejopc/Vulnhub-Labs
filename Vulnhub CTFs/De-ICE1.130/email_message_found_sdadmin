Message: Hey there Paul!  I would gladly bring myself and my son over 
tomorrow after work!  I would only be hesitant to come over if you 
invited Fred over too... He just freaks me out sometimes.  It doesnt 
help that he locks himself up in his office and is anti-social during 
lunch hours... On top of that he calls himself the "databaser"!  I mean, 
who in thier right mind does that?  Either way, I will most likely be 
there tomorrow.  I look forward to it!   -Mark
